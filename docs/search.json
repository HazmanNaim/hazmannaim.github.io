    "section": "",
    "text": "One day, while watching a YouTube video from one of my favorite creators, I came across a sponsored segment. I usually skip these parts, but this time I did not because the promoted content really caught my attention.\nThe platform being promoted was called CodeCrafters. It is a place to sharpen your programming skills by building real-world projects, step by step.\nI have tried platforms like HackerRank and LeetCode before. While those platforms are great for learning core programming logic, I often found myself wondering, “Why am I doing this? Just to pass interviews?” With CodeCrafters, my first impression was different. Instead of solving disconnected puzzles, you build real systems—like creating an HTTP server from scratch.\nAfter trying a few challenges, I can say I really enjoy it. Not only does it improve my programming skills, but it also helps me understand how things work under the hood. Finally, I get the feeling of “Ohh, so this is why I am doing this.”\nI liked it so much that I decided to subscribe for a full year (big thanks to my company for sponsoring it!). And now, the adventure begins.\nI will be tracking my progress in real time—check it out here!"
